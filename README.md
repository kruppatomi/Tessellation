#### You can see this site here: https://voronoi-tessellation.herokuapp.com/ click the continue as guest button(register and login (sql features) not available yet on heroku)
#### This is a dotnet MVC project with d3.js where you can create tessellations
* if you want to use all the functions of the project, you have to make a ms sql database and connect it to the project. You can find the sample table data in the SampleDbData folder.
* You are able to use this application without database too, just click the login as guest button!
#### How to edit the voronoi
* Hit "a" on keyboard to add new point to the canvas it will follow your mouse, hit "a" again to put it down.
* Hit "s" once and select is active(If you hit again select is turned off). The red point is the selected point while select is active hit "g" to grab/move points. Hit "g" again to release the point.
* While select is active hit "d" to remove point.
* If you finished the voronoi editing hit the Let's tesselate button and your tessellation is ready.
* The default is 2x2 but you can costumise it.
* After clicking the Let's tesselate button your picture is ready to download (png or jpeg).
